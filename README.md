## Task 1: Text categorization based on Softmax Regression
Language: Python

Tool: numpy

Feature extraction: Bag-of-word, N-gram

Data: [Classify the sentiment of sentences from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews)

Goal: Implement **Softmax Regression** to categorize different text into different sentiment.

+ ***Update complete code on March 15th.***

## Task 2: Text categorization based on RNN & CNN
Language: Python

Tool: [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), numpy

Feature extraction: Random word embedding, [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) word embedding

Data: [Classify the sentiment of sentences from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews)

Goal: Implement Recursive Neural Network **(RNN)** and Convolution Neural Network **(CNN)** to categorize different text into different sentiment.

+ ***Update complete code on March 29th.***
